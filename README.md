# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
## AIM

To develop a code to find the shortest route from the source to the destination point using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

## THEORY
Explain the problem statement

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Identify a location in the google map:

### STEP 2:
Select a specific number of nodes with distance

### STEP 3:
Create a dictionary with all the node pairs (keys) and their respective distances as the values

### STEP 4:
Implement the search algorithm by passing any two nodes/places to find a possible route.

### STEP 5:
Display the route sequence.


## ROUTE MAP
![route map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75235704/168218587-0939552d-1375-4a45-877f-4c0f049ec9ae.png)

## PROGRAM
```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
import math
import sys
from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter
from itertools import combinations
import heapq
```
## PROPLEMS
This is the abstract class. Specific problem domains will subclass this
```python
class Problem(object):
    """The abstract class for a formal problem. A new domain subclasses this,
    overriding `actions` and `results`, and perhaps other methods.
    The default heuristic is 0 and the default action cost is 1 for all states.
    When yiou create an instance of a subclass, specify `initial`, and `goal` states 
    (or give an `is_goal` method) and perhaps other keyword args for the subclass."""

    def __init__(self, initial=None, goal=None, **kwds): 
        self.__dict__.update(initial=initial, goal=goal, **kwds) 
        
    def actions(self, state):        
        raise NotImplementedError
    def result(self, state, action): 
        raise NotImplementedError
    def is_goal(self, state):        
        return state == self.goal
    def action_cost(self, s, a, s1): 
        return 1
    
    def __str__(self):
        return '{0}({1}, {2})'.format(
            type(self).__name__, self.initial, self.goal)
```
## Nodes
This is the Node in the search tree. Helper functions (expand, path_actions, path_states) use this Node class.
```python
class Node:
    "A Node in a search tree."
    def __init__(self, state, parent=None, action=None, path_cost=0):
        self.__dict__.update(state=state, parent=parent, action=action, path_cost=path_cost)

    def __str__(self): 
        return '<{0}>'.format(self.state)
    def __len__(self): 
        return 0 if self.parent is None else (1 + len(self.parent))
    def __lt__(self, other): 
        return self.path_cost < other.path_cost

failure = Node('failure', path_cost=math.inf) # Indicates an algorithm couldn't find a solution.
cutoff  = Node('cutoff',  path_cost=math.inf) # Indicates iterative deepening search was cut off.
```
## Helper functions
```python
def expand(problem, node):
    "Expand a node, generating the children nodes."
    s = node.state
    for action in problem.actions(s):
        s1 = problem.result(s, action)
        cost = node.path_cost + problem.action_cost(s, action, s1)
        yield Node(s1, node, action, cost)
        

def path_actions(node):
    "The sequence of actions to get to this node."
    if node.parent is None:
        return []  
    return path_actions(node.parent) + [node.action]


def path_states(node):
    "The sequence of states to get to this node."
    if node in (cutoff, failure, None): 
        return []
    return path_states(node.parent) + [node.state]
```
## Search Algorithm : Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
```python
class PriorityQueue:
    """A queue in which the item with minimum f(item) is always popped first."""

    def __init__(self, items=(), key=lambda x: x): 
        self.key = key
        self.items = [] # a heap of (score, item) pairs
        for item in items:
            self.add(item)
         
    def add(self, item):
        """Add item to the queuez."""
        pair = (self.key(item), item)
        heapq.heappush(self.items, pair)

    def pop(self):
        """Pop and return the item with min f(item) value."""
        return heapq.heappop(self.items)[1]
    
    def top(self): return self.items[0][1]

    def __len__(self): return len(self.items)

def best_first_search(problem, f):
    "Search nodes with minimum f(node) value first."
    node = Node(problem.initial)
    frontier = PriorityQueue([node], key=f)
    reached = {problem.initial: node}
    while frontier:
        node = frontier.pop()
        if problem.is_goal(node.state):
            return node
        for child in expand(problem, node):
            s = child.state
            if s not in reached or child.path_cost < reached[s].path_cost:
                reached[s] = child
                frontier.add(child)
    return failure

def g(n): 
    return n.path_cost
```
## Route Finding Problems
```python
def breadth_first_search(problem):
   "Search shallowest nodes in the search tree first."
   node = Node(problem.initial)
   if problem.is_goal(problem.initial):
       return node
   frontier = FIFOQueue([node])
   reached = {problem.initial}
   while frontier:
       node = frontier.pop()
       for child in expand(problem, node):
           s = child.state
           if problem.is_goal(s):
               return child
           if s not in reached:
               reached.add(s)
               frontier.appendleft(child)
   return failure
```
## SOLUTION JUSTIFICATION:
Once the algorithm has been carried out you can find the least weight path to all permanently labelled nodes. We don’t need a new diagram for each pass.
## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:

Hence, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm was implemented for a route finding problem.
